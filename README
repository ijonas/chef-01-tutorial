chef-01-tutorial Source Code
============================

This repo contains the source code to follow the Chef-Solo tutorial posted at http://www.denofubiquity.com/howto/installing-a-wordpress-blog-with-chef-solo/.

Please follow my instructions in the tutorial to get Chef installed. The five recipes included in this repo are almost identical to the Opscode originals, with a small ammendment in the Wordpress recipe to allow it to run on a Chef-Solo instance.

Installation
============
mkdir /tmp/chef-solo
git clone http://github.com/ijonas/chef-01-tutorial.git cookbooks
cd cookbooks
mv blogstack.json solo.rb
cd ~
sudo chef-solo -c ~/solo.rb -j ~/blogstack.json
